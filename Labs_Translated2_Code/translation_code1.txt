#lab: Google cloud fundermentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

## Objectives
In this lab you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
     - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud platform (GCP) console

     - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using command-line interface

     - Connect between the two instances

## STEPS  
1. Create Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud platform (GCP) console

   gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debain-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v-20190213" --subnet "default" --tags "http"

   gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW --destintion=INGRESS --rules=http:80 --target-tags=http

2. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using command-line interface
    
    i. Use this command to display all the zones in the region Qwikslab assigned (us-central1)
       
       gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

    ii. Use this command to set your default zone to the one that you just choose

        gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b  
 
    iii. Use this command to a vm instance  my-vm-2

        gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debain-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v-20190213" --subnet "default" --tags "http"

3. Connect between the two instances

   1. Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
      
      - Connect to my-vm-2:

        gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

      - ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:

        ping -c 3 my-vm-1

      - Use the ssh command to open the command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:

        ssh my-vm-1

      - At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install Nginx web server:
        
        sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

      - Use the nano text editor to add to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

        sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

      - Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

        Hi from nnameka

        - Then exit
          
           exit

      - Exit the editor and confirm that the web server is serving your new page, At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

        curl http://localhost/
                
        - Result: The response will be the source of the web server's home page, including  you line of custom text.

      - To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

         exit

      - To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute thos command:

        curl http://my-vm-1/

        - Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page including your line of custom text.

2. Now get the external IP of the my-vm-1 instance from this command:

     gcloud compute instances list --zone us-central1-a

3. Paste the copied IP address of my-vm-1 into a new browser tab and hit enter.

    - Result: you will see your web sever's home page, including your custom text.
